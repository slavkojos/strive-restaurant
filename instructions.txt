Strivestaurant
Transform DishComments functional component into a class based one.
In the ReservationForm component change the rendering method, returning the Alert when necessary or the Form otherwise with an if/else statement.
Change NavBar component in a class-based one; create a constructor and log a message in the console as the component starts to render.
In the DishComments component change the ternary operator with a short-circuit one; insert also a setTimeout function in the componentDidMount method to delay the setState by 1 sec.
In the Home component, hide the DishComments component with a short-circuit operator if the selected dish name is "Amatriciana".
In the Home component, show an alert component instead of the ReservationForm one if even a single a comment of the selected dish has a rating below 5.
In Home.jsx give a "header" prop to the Reservations component. If present, this component should display it instead of the generic 'RESERVATIONS' in its h3.
In the Home component use a ternary operator to replace the text inside the h1 and the p tags above the carousel with the values of the props "newTitle" and "newPayoff" respectively, if present.
Change the "Strive for food" text in the navbar to "The perfect place for pasta lovers" if one of the elements in the props.links array contains the string "Alfredo".
